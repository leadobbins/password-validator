To build, use "mvn clean install".  It will build a jar file called password-validation.jar.

Once the password-validation.jar is built, put it into a maven repository (the jar file contains a pom.xml which can be used to install it into a maven repository).

To use in eclipse, import the maven project file included in the zip file into Maven via the Import option on your eclipse ide.
